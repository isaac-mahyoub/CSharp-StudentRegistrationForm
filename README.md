# C Sharp Project
## Project Name:
    Student Registration Form
## Discription:
    My first projec in C# is a student data registration form.
    The project aims to create a simple user interface that allows user to input student data such as name,
    gmail, password, favorite color, country, and birthdate.
    The data is temporarily stored within the application and is not saved to a database.
    The project focuses on learning the fundamentals of C#,
    such as handling inputs and outputs, data processing, and user interface programming.
